// In infinity case, the output is Y: unbound, T2: unbound, T1: unbound. The reason is, those threads are executed after Browse.

// In finite 1 case, the output is Y:3 T2:3 T1:unbound, The thread runs after " X = 3" so we have Y = X = 3. Then for the "T1 T2" one,
// thread of T2 runs first and then "skip Browse T2" , "skip Browse T1", finally, thread of T1. So we have T2 = 3, T1 = unbound.
